## processes


Process is a binary program that is currently running in the linux system. It can be viewed by using the `ps` command.

A binary program can be created just as we create `a.out` files using the gcc compiler. The program when run, becomes the process.

Each process by default, gets three file descriptors that are attached to it. They are `stdin`, the standard input pipe, `stdout`, the standard output pipe,  `stderr`, the standard error pipe.

Linux is a multi-process operating system. Each process gets an illusion that it has the access to the full hardware for itself. Each process is interleaved in execution using the concept called scheduling. The scheduling takes many parameters as input to run one of the scheduling algorithms. There are many scheduling algorithms such as roundrobin, FIFO etc. Each of these scheduling algorithms can be selectable or just built-in directly into the Linux kernel that comes with the Linux OS types such as Fedora or Ubuntu. The scheduler is also a thread or a function that gets a periodic interrupt via the hardware timing pulse. At each pulse the scheduler finds out the next process that is eligible to run on the CPU(s). The scheduler then places the process into the Run queue and wakes it up and places the already running process into wait queue and saves all of the registers that it used and etc. The woken up process will then execute on the CPU. The scheduling is a vast and a large topic to cover and it is only explained here in this paragraph  brief.

In linux `stdin` is described as file descriptor 0, `stdout` is described as file descriptor 1, and `stderr` is described as file descriptor 2. Upon the each successful pipe / msgqueue / socket call, the file descriptors will get incremented in number usually (i.e from 3, 4 and so on) most of the time. A file descriptor that is opened must always be closed with a corresponding `close` system call or the similar one. This is a good programming practice.

Each process is identified by a pid (called process identifier). Process ids are 16 bit numbers (Signed numbers). The program can obtain its pid using `getpid()` call. The parent process id is obtained by using `getppid()`. 

**NOTE**: In linux the process 1 is always the init process.

The below program gets the pid and parent pid.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("process id %d\n", getpid());
    printf("parent process id %d\n", getppid());
    
    return 0;
}

```

The parent process of the program that we have currently executed is always the shell that we ran the binary.

The below example is for the `ps` command.

```shell
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
22963 ttys000    0:00.29 -bash
22860 ttys001    0:00.01 -bash
22863 ttys002    0:00.02 -bash
```



more detailed output can be obtained about the current processes can be done using the **-e** option `ps -e`.



```shell

The `ps` is detailed much more in the manual pages (`man ps`). Eitherway, the most useful command is `ps -e`.



pid 0  (and is never shown in the `ps` command output) is a swapper process and pid 1 is an init process. The init process is the one that is called by the kernel to initialise the userspace.

A process has the following states:

**Running** -  The process is either running or is ready to run.

**Waiting** - The process is waiting for an event or a resource. Such as socket wait for the recv etc.

**Stopped** - The process has been stopped with a signal such as Ctrl + Z combination or under a debugger.


When a process is created, the kernel allocates enough resources and stores the information about the process. The kernel also creates an entry about the process in the `/proc` file system. For ex: for a process such as `init` with pid 1, it stores the name of the process into `/proc/<pidname>/cmdline` file, and stores links to the opened files in `/proc/<pidname>/fd/` directory and it keeps a lot of other information such as memory usage by this process, scheduling statistics etc. When a process is stopped, the information and all the allocated memory and resources will then automatically be freed up by the kernel.

## setsid system call

The `setsid` system call creates a new session if the calling process is not the process group leader. When called, the calling process becomes the process group leader. This means that the session id will be same as that of the process id.

Generally `setsid` is called right after the call to `fork` system call in the child process.

`setsid` is mainly used when daemonizing a process. 

### Daemonize

Daemons or system daemons detach from the controlling terminal and have the parent as the init process. Daemons always run in the background.

Below are few steps in becoming a daemon.

1. `fork` and exit parent.
2. call `setsid` in child process.
3. move `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` to `/dev/null`.
4. change the working directory to `/`.

Below is an example of such in C.

```c
int daemonize()
{
    pid_t pid;
    int ret;

    pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to fork\n");
        return -1;
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        exit(0); // parent process exits
    }

    ret = setsid();
    if (ret < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to setsid\n");
        return -1;
    }

    int fd;

    fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);
    if (fd >= 0) {
        dup2(fd, 0); // 0 is stdin
        dup2(fd, 1); // 1 is stdout
        dup2(fd, 2); // 2 is stderr

        close(fd);
    }

    ret = chdir("/");
    if (ret < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to chdir\n");
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## getpriority and setpriority system calls

## scheduling system calls

Linux defines the following Scheduling system calls.

| Scheduling system call | description |
|------------------------|-------------|

## enviornmental variables

The environmental variables allow the system to get some of the items for use in the program.

Environmental variables can be found with the use of `getenv` function call.

Below is an example of `getenv`. Download [here](https://github.com/DevNaga/gists/blob/master/getenv.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char *path_ = getenv("PATH");
    if (!path_) {
        printf("PATH variable can't be found\n");
    } else {
        printf("PATH %s\n", path_);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

environmental variables are found as well by using the command `env` in the shell.

for example to define an enviornmental variable within the current shell, use `export` command.

something like the below,

```shell
export TEST_C_ENV="hello"
```

and doing `env | grep TEST_C_ENV` gives,

```shell
env | grep TEST
TEST_C_ENV=hello

```

with the above program having `PATH` replaced with `TEST_C_ENV`, it looks below..

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char *path_ = getenv("TEST_C_ENV");
    if (!path_) {
        printf("TEST_C_ENV variable can't be found\n");
    } else {
        printf("TEST_C_ENV %s\n", path_);
    }

    return 0;
}

```

All the export commands done on this variable only apply to this shell, and if a new shell is created the variable however will not be present.

any further export calls to TEST_C_ENV as,

```shell
export TEST_C_ENV="hello1"
```

will replace the existing value with new value. That means it gets overwritten.


to append the value to the TEST_C_ENV, the value must preceed with the variable itself with a `:`.

```shell
TEST_C_ENV=$TEST_C_ENV:test1
``` 

to unset an environmental variable, use `unset`. calling unset on TEST_C_ENV as

```shell
unset TEST_C_ENV
```
running the code to get TEST_C_ENV again, gives,

```shell
./a.out 
TEST_C_ENV variable can't be found
```

Alternatively, the program can set the environmental variables using `putenv`. Below is an example of `putenv` system call, Download [here](https://github.com/DevNaga/gists/blob/master/putenv.c)

The prototype of `putenv` is as follow,

```c
int putenv(const char *var_val);
```

Below is an example of `putenv`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int i = 0;
    char var[20];
    int ret;

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "<%s> var=val\n", argv[0]);
        return -1;
    }

    ret = putenv(argv[1]);
    if (ret < 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    printf("Set %s\n", argv[1]);

    memset(var, 0, sizeof(var));

    while (argv[1][i] != '=') {
        if (i >= sizeof(var) - 1) {
            break;
        }

        var[i] = argv[1][i];
        i ++;
    }

    var[i] = '\0';

    printf("get %s=%s\n", var, getenv(var));

    return 0;
}

```

Another function is `setenv` and the prototype is as follows.

```c
int setenv(const char *variable, const char *value, int override);
```

This simply sets the variable to value to the environment. If `override` is set to 1, then the existing value is overwritten. If there is no variable and `override` is set to 0, then new variable is created.

Below is an example of `setenv`. Download [here](https://github.com/DevNaga/gists/blob/master/setenv.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int i = 0;
    char var[20];
    int ret;

    if (argc != 3) {
        fprintf(stderr, "<%s> var val\n", argv[0]);
        return -1;
    }

    ret = setenv(argv[1], argv[2], 1);
    if (ret < 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    printf("Set %s\n", argv[2]);


    printf("get %s=%s\n", argv[1], getenv(argv[1]));

    return 0;
}

```
