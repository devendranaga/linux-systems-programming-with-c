# Systems Programming under Linux

#### I Am restarting the development of this book ####

Appreciate it if you want to support the development: https://leanpub.com/linuxsystemprogrammingwithc/


Hello. Welcome to the Preface.

The book tries to cover the systems programming under linux based operating systems in **C**. The most of the part in this book is my personal experience with programming in the systems level of the linux operating system.

All the source code examples described in this book are self-contained and are compiled and ran on a linux operating system.

This book is not for those who seek for kernel programming topics. This book deals with the layer above it, the system calls and middlewear.

Almost all of the code samples are kept at [GitHub](https://github.com/madmax440/gists.git). Please feel free to clone the repository.



Please open a ticket for grammatical errors and bugs \(No more feature requests are planned\).



NOTE: As of today \(December 24  2016\) the book's development is stopped and no more content is going to be published. The reason being that the book's content is more than enough to get a person to basic to intermediate coding level and get hooked to the beautiful world of systems programming under the Linux operating system. To read more advance content, please purchase the book online [here](https://leanpub.com/linuxsystemprogrammingwithc). Thank you for your kind co-operation.
