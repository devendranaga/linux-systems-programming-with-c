# First Chapter

## Preface

This chapter mostly concentrates on the C programming language and also gives out little bit python scripts to encourage the reader to learn the Python programming language.

### The C programming Language

* C programming language is invented by the great programmers **Dennis Ritchie** and **Brian Kernighan**.
* We use C programming language in many areas such as in embedded devices, high performance backend software, gaming engines etc.
* C is highly desired programming language to write any performance oriented code.
* C is still a majorly used language in the current competing world where there are new programming languages every quarter.
* C is very useful in programming device drivers or the software that can be closely written to the hardware.
* C programming language is implemented by the C compiler. We use gcc as the C compiler under linux and BSD'ish operating systems. Gcc implements the C programming language specification. The compiler converts the program written in C into the binary program that is suited for the given architecture (X86, ARM, PPC, MIPS and so on).
* To install gcc on the Ubuntu simply use the following command

        sudo apt-get install gcc build-essentials

  Under Fedora (as root):

        dnf install gcc
* pick an editor to type the source code such as `atom` editor or `vim` that colors the types, functions etc.. to ease up understanding and coding.

### The Python programming Language

* Python is invented by the great programmer **Guido van Rossum**.
* Python is a typeless language. We do not need to specify the variable types, we simply use them for the purpose and they become the types.
* Python is very useful in the automation, server side programming, backend system implementation, Maps, quick scripting and now-a-days it is being used in the Artificial Intelligence.
* Python is an interpreter language. Meaning that an interpreter is needed to understand the program written in Python. This also means that the Python programs can be executed on any operating system and on any processor architecture provided that there is an interpreter for that operating system and the architecture.
* Python language is extensible with the use of modules. The modules are like the libraries that extend the functionality of the Python.
* To install Python interpreter on the Ubuntu simply use the following command

        sudo apt-get install python

  Under Fedora (as root):

        dnf install python
* pip is a tool used to install python modules. To install pip on the Ubuntu use the following command

        sudo apt-get install python-pip

  Under Fedora

        dnf install python-pip
